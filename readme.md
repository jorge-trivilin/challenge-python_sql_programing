### SQL test
After accessing our database, create queries using the schema **looqbox_challenge** to answer the following questions:

1) What are the 10 most expensive products in the company?
2) What sections do the 'BEBIDAS' and 'PADARIA' departments have?
3) What was the total sale of products (in $) of each Business Area in the first quarter of 2019?

### Cases
#### 1) The Dev Team was tired of developing the same old queries just varying the filters accordingly to their boss demands.
As a new member of the crew, your mission now is to create a dynamic function, on the most flexible of ways, to produce queries and retrieve a dataframe based on three parameters:

- product_code: integer

- store_code: integer

- date: list of ISO-like strings

- Date e.g.
  - ['2019-01-01', '2019-01-31'] → Python

  - c('2019-01-01', '2019-01-31') → R

It should look like this
my_data = retrieve_data(product_code, store_code, date)

Make your team proud!

Extra instructions:
Retrieve all columns from table data_product_sales.

#### 2) A brand new client sent you two ready-to-go queries. Those are listed below:

Query 1:

```
SELECT
      STORE_CODE,
      STORE_NAME,
      START_DATE,
      END_DATE,
      BUSINESS_NAME,
      BUSINESS_CODE
FROM data_store_cad
```
Query 2:

```
SELECT
        STORE_CODE,
        DATE,
        SALES_VALUE,
        SALES_QTY
FROM data_store_sales
WHERE DATE BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
```
In addition, he gave you this set of instructions:

- You must not modify my queries!

- Please filter the period between this given range: 
  - ['2019-10-01','2019-12-31']

#### 3) Building your own visualization

Create at least one chart using the table **IMDB_movies**. The code must be in R or Python, and you are free to use any libraries, data in the table and graphic format. Explain why you chose the visualization (or visualizations) you are submitting.

## Stack
- MySQL database 
- R/Python

## Submitting
- Send an e-mail to the person that you are in contact within Looqbox!
- Your answer must be sent in PDF format with the code snippets used in each question, as well as the result obtained (values, tables, graphs)
